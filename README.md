# Coding Events

This is a coding events app.

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to allow individuals to create all different events.

## Current State

In the apps current state you can: 
View All Events, Create Event, Delete, Edit, Create Category, or View All Categories.

## Future Improvements

In the future we would like to add a 'Person' class so that the user may hold necessary info about users of the app. <br  />
<br  />
1.) We need to create a PersonController. <br  />
2.) We need to create a PersonRepository. <br  />
3.) We need to create a Person model. <br  />
4.) We a one-to-many relationship between Person and Event. <br  />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Person can hold or attendee many Events.
